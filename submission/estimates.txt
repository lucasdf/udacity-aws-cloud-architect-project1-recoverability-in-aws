RTO refers to the time needed to recover from an outage.
Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: A single AZ outage shouldn't need any time to recover, since db access is done using the same endpoint and failover is automatic.
Minimum RTO for a single region outage: Amazon says that the promotion process takes a few minutes (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html#USER_ReadRepl.Promote), and that would be the required RTO time in case of a single region outage (the time needed to promote the read replica in the other region).

RPO refers to the amount of time the service might lose data in case of major problems.
Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: Since this configuration uses Multi-AZ, there is no RPO for a single AZ outrage. That's because write requests are synchronously replicated across multi-az replicas, which means that data is only considered written when it has been succesfully written in all the configurate availability zones (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html).
Minimum RPO for a single region outage: Data replication across read replicas, including cross-region read replicas such as the one configured in this deployment, have asynchronous replication (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html). As such, a single region outage might cause data loss in case some of the data has not been replicated to the read replica. Since the main database has a daily backup, an outage in the region of the main database might cause a full day loss of data.

Example of outage timeline:
- 00:00 - There is a region-wide issue in the region where the main database is running.
- 00:02 - A monitoring that verifies the number of transactions per minute reaches the two full minutes without transactions and triggers an alert, which sends messages to the on-call staff.
- 00:03 - The on-call staff acknowledges the alert
- 00:10 - On-call staff starts investigating the issue. He quickly sees that there is a region-wide outage.
- 00:12 - The read replica in another region is promoted.
- 00:20 - Applications are updated to use the promoted database in a new region.
- 00:30 - Applications are using the database in a separate region and are fully functional.
